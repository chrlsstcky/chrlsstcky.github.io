Coupizza is no longer feasible. While it was a great platform for learning, it's waned in real-world utiliy, especially with the recent changes to the FB API. It sort of became a proof-of-concept project a long time ago - applying what I was learning early on in web development and disregarding usability. I'm terrified of the possibility of adding to the trash-heap of less that usable web applications that exist. I seriously dislike littering. I do believe there is a place for a GOOD coupon finder (for pizza and otherwise), however the scope of that kind of project is beyond my capabilities (and likely any single person). It's possibly the most valuable thing I've done in terms of sheer learning, so it definitely isn't a total loss.  

Since then I've been focusing on finding the next time-dump. I've been dipping my toes into AI/machine learning as well as contributing to <a href='https://github.com/devtools-html/debugger.html'>debugger.html</a> - something I'm really excited to contribute to. I've been following the seemingly natural progression of learning development and have started submerging myself in the network/admin side of things. Network security is something that naturally interests me, so I've been learning more in that arena as well. I plan on becoming more active with blogging - especially if I feel I have a perspective worth sharing/looking back on.
