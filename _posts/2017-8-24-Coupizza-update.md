I've decided to expand my database API to accept Facebook posts from merchant accounts as well as Twitter timelines. The problem with using Twitter as the main source of data for this scenario is that user accounts are fairly inconsistent in the data they provide. For instance location data is very unpredictable. I've found Facebook's GraphAPI data to be much more consistent, though it may take stricter parsing algorithms to handle the sheer amount of data that the FB API provides, but this definitely seems doable with a few tweaks to the algorithms I'm currently using with the Twitter API.
